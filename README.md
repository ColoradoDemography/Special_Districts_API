# Special_Districts_API
Query DOLA Database for Special District Boundaries and Information

Notes
Make sure lgbasic file in postgres has NA in place of any nulls

Need to automate creation of lgbasic file in postgres and limlevy.json, pulling from oracle. Then a geopts.json file has to be created and the 
jsons stored in google storage

Then automate create of the special district shapefiles and also store them in google storage.
